      If you have recently adopted a dog from a shelter, gotten a new puppy, or notice your pet displaying signs of anxiety when you leave home, you may want to look into taking them to a veterinarian or behavioral trainer to address a symptom known as Separation Anxiety ( the excessive fear or anxiety about separation from home or an attachment figure*). But how can you be sure? The following article will address the cause of separation anxiety in dogs, it's common symptoms, and an effective method to ease the disorder before you ultimately decide what's best for your pet - whether it be home remedial methods or a licensed veterinarian.
      </p>

      <p class="content">
        After centuries of selective breeding and domestication, dogs have continued to evolve to become more emotionally responsive to human behavior.* The bond or attachment formed between human and dog can be likened to the bond developed between mother and child.

      </p>
      <p class="content">
        Likewise, dogs that are predisposed to anxiety disorders, such as those who are adopted, puppies, or dogs who have been less socialized to be without their owner, may display symptoms of high anxiety when they noticed that their owner is about to leave or that they may be soon isolated.

      </p>
      <p class="content">
              Just as how a child may cry out or scream when their parents leave them on their first day of school, anxious dogs may also display similar signs of high stress and depression. Such signs may include:
          <ul class="list-of-symptoms">
        <li>Whining or barking</li>
        <li>Defecation</li>
        <li>Urination</li>
        <li>Destruction of nearby items at site of the owner's exit</li>
        <li>Attempts of escape</li>
        </ul>

      <h4>Methods to Alleviate Anxiety in your dog</h4>

       <p class="content">
        Severe anxiety and separation disorder can lead to self-mutilation behavior in your pet, such as over-grooming to the point of removing actual flesh or self-harm in attempt to escape. Keeping this in mind, please be mindful of the individual effectiveness of the following suggestions and monitor your dog's health for if/when you decide to get them professional help.
      </p>

      <p class="content">
        The most popular and perhaps most effective method to reduce or eliminate anxiety-related separation disorder is systematic desensitization, in which the owner begins with a short amount of times with isolation (generally with 3 minutes at a time) and gradually increases this amount of time to perhaps an average work day (8 hours).
      </p>
      <p class="content">
       Although the method can prove to be long and bit tedious, this method can prove to be even more effective with the introduction of food at the time of leaving or favorite toys. The ideal is contrast the impending anxiety caused by the owner's separation with a pleasurable state such as eating or introducing a new toy.

      </p>
      <p class="content">
No matter what you choose, remember to watch and analyze your pet's behavior closely when changing habits and adjust accordingly.
